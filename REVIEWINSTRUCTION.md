## Branch work construction:

### Check out the project

1. Go to the bitbucket.org and log in your account
2. Go to the DBSpread-Web repository and copy the repository URL on the
   top right corner.
3. Open the IntelliJ, click open the file, then choose "Git", then put your
   repository URL copied from step 2 on the Git repository URL.
OR
   Click VCS->Git->Clone in the toolbar, and then follow the same instruction
   as in the Step 2.

4. Now you have a local copy of the DBSpread-Web project!


### Create a new branch

1. If you want to add your codes to the project, create yourself a new branch.
2. Click VCS->Git->Branches->New Branch, then name your branch the goal of
this part of the code.
3. Now you have your own branch!


### Commit your branch

1. After you finish your branch or you want to commit the changes, you can commit
it and push to the repositories(update your branch or merge to your your teammates' branch).
2. Click VCS->Git->Push, and choose the files which you have changed and you
  want to commit, then check all the fields on the "Before Commit" region except
  for the last one.
3. Add the detailed comments on your changes to the codes. Then click
  Commit->Commit and Push. Only push necessary files to the repository!
4. If your branch is finalized and you want to merge your branch to the production,
   you need to make a pull request to master branch.
5. Go to the bitbucket.org and in the DBSpread-Web repository, click Branches
   in the left toolbar.
6. You will see the branch you just pushed, click it to make a pull request.
7. Correctly choose the origin and the destination where you want to commit the branch
   to(teammates or the master branch or others). Put both Mangesh and Paul as reviewers.
   If your branch is finalized and will no longer be used, choose to choose to close
   the branch when it is checked by masters. While you can always create a new branch if
   your current branch is closed when you continue your work.
8. Done.
